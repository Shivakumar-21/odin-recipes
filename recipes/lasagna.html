    <h3>steps to prepare lasagna:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, usually around 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic, sauté until softened and fragrant. Add the ground meat (beef, pork, turkey, or sausage) and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat if necessary. Stir in the tomato sauce or marinara sauce, along with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Prepare the noodles: If you're using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions until they're just al dente. If you're using oven-ready noodles, you can skip this step.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cheese mixture: In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add some chopped fresh herbs like basil or parsley for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to prevent the noodles from sticking. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Add a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat the layers until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown slightly.</li>
        <li>Let it rest: Once the lasagna is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot, garnished with fresh basil leaves if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
