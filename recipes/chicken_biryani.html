        <li>Various spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro and mint leaves</li>
        <li>Green chilies (optional, for heat)</li>

    <h3>steps to prepare chicken biryani:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, salt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and optionally some lemon juice.</li>      
        <li>Mix well to coat the chicken evenly with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let the chicken marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves, along with salt.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% done. It should still have a slight bite to it. Be careful not to overcook the rice as it will continue cooking later.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the onions.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the sliced onions until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, spread a layer of partially cooked rice at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Arrange the marinated chicken pieces on top of the rice.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped tomatoes, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice, chicken, and other ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle saffron-infused milk over the rice for color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to seal in the steam.</li>
        <li>Cook the biryani on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes before opening the lid.</li>
        <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers together.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip), salad, or a side of spicy curry.</li>
    </ol>
